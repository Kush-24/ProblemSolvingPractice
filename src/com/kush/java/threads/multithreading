Answers:

1. **Thread Pools:**
   - Thread pool is a pool of worker threads that are ready to perform tasks. It improves performance by reusing existing threads rather than creating new ones. `ExecutorService` provides a higher-level replacement for managing threads, and `ForkJoinPool` is designed for recursive task execution.

2. **Concurrency Utilities:**
   - The `java.util.concurrent` package provides higher-level concurrency utilities like `ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, and `CountDownLatch`. These utilities simplify the development of concurrent applications by offering abstractions for thread management and synchronization.

3. **Synchronization:**
   - `synchronized` methods and blocks are used to achieve mutual exclusion, but they differ in scope. Methods synchronize the entire method, while blocks allow synchronization of specific code sections. The `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provides more flexibility with explicit lock objects.
   
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
class SynchronizationExample {
    // Example 1: Synchronized Method
    public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
        System.out.println("Start synchronizedMethod");
        // Critical section
        System.out.println("End synchronizedMethod");
    }

    // Example 2: Synchronized Block
    public void synchronizedBlock() {
        System.out.println("Start synchronizedBlock");
        // Non-critical section
        // Synchronized block
        synchronized (this) {
            // Critical section
            System.out.println("Inside synchronizedBlock");
        }
        // Non-critical section
        System.out.println("End synchronizedBlock");
    }

    // Example 3: ReentrantLock
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    public void reentrantLockExample() {
        System.out.println("Start reentrantLockExample");
        // Non-critical section
        lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
        try {
            // Critical section
            System.out.println("Inside reentrantLockExample");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Release the lock in a finally block
        }
        System.out.println("End reentrantLockExample");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronizationExample example = new SynchronizationExample();
        new Thread(() -> example.synchronizedMethod()).start();
        new Thread(() -> example.synchronizedBlock()).start();
        new Thread(() -> example.reentrantLockExample()).start();
    }
}


4. **Atomic Operations:**
   - The `volatile` keyword ensures visibility of changes across threads, but it does not provide atomicity. `AtomicInteger` is a class in `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, offering atomic operations for integers, preventing race conditions.
   

5. **Deadlock and Starvation:**
   - Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other. Starvation is when a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources. Both situations require careful design and synchronization to be avoided.

6. **Thread Safety and Immutability:**
   - Thread safety ensures that a piece of code can be safely executed by multiple threads concurrently. Immutability, achieved through `final` and immutable classes, eliminates the need for synchronization as objects cannot be modified.

7. **Java Memory Model:**
   - The Java Memory Model specifies how threads interact through memory. `volatile` ensures changes are visible across threads, and `synchronized` provides both visibility and ordering guarantees. Memory barriers ensure proper synchronization.

8. **Fork-Join Framework:**
   - The Fork-Join framework is part of `java.util.concurrent` for parallelizing recursive algorithms. It involves dividing tasks into smaller subtasks and combining results. Work-stealing improves efficiency by allowing idle threads to steal tasksfrom busy ones.

9. **Parallel Streams:**
   - Parallel streams in Java allow concurrent processing of data. They use the Fork-Join framework behind the scenes, automatically partitioning data and utilizing multiple cores. Parallel streams are suitable for CPU-bound tasks.

10. **Thread Local Variables:**
    - Thread-local variables are variables that have a separate copy for each thread. They are useful for storing thread-specific information without the need for synchronization. This can improve performance by avoiding contention for shared resources.
